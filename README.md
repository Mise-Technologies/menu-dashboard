# Menu Dashboard
## Running Locally:
Make sure you have a local instance of `menu-service` running or go to `client.js` to point to dev server.

If you have not already, install `gatsby-cli`: 
`$ npm install -g gatsby-cli`

Create a `.env.development` file with:
```
GATSBY_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

Start development server:
`$ gatsby develop`
